			<!--<span class="justify">Abstract: <span class="black">Bucket Elimination (BE) is a framework that encompasses several algorithms, including Belief Propagation (BP) and variable elimination for Constraint Optimisation Problems (COPs). BE has significant computational requirements that can be addressed by using GPUs to parallelise its fundamental operations, i.e., composition and marginalisation, which operate on functions represented by large tables. We propose a novel approach to parallelise these operations with GPUs, which optimises the table layout so to achieve better performance in terms of increased speedup and scalability. Our approach allows us to process incomplete tables (i.e., tables with some missing variables assignments), which often occur in several practical applications (such as the ones we consider in our dataset). Finally, we can process tables that are larger than the GPU memory. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art technique to parallelise BP on GPUs, achieving better speedups (up to +466% w.r.t. such parallel technique). We test our method on a publicly available COP dataset, measuring a speedup up to 696.02x w.r.t. the sequential version. The ability of our technique to process large tables is crucial in this scenario, in which most of the instances generate tables larger than the GPU memory, and hence they cannot be solved with previous GPU techniques related to BE.</span></span>-->

			<!--<span class="justify">Abstract: <span class="black">We consider Bucket Elimination (BE), a popular algorithmic framework to solve Constraint Optimisation Problems (COPs). We focus on the parallelisation of the most computationally intensive operations of BE, i.e., join sum and maximisation, which are key ingredients in several close variants of the BE framework (including Belief Propagation on Junction Trees and Distributed COP techniques such as ActionGDL and DPOP).
In particular, we propose CUBE, a highly-parallel GPU implementation of such operations, which adopts an efficient memory layout allowing all threads to independently locate their input and output addresses in memory, hence achieving a high computational throughput. We compare CUBE with the most recent GPU implementation of BE.
Our results show that CUBE achieves significant speed-ups (up to two orders of magnitude) w.r.t. the counterpart approach, showing a dramatic decrease of the runtime w.r.t. the serial version (i.e., up to 652x faster). 
More important, such speed-ups increase when the complexity of the problem grows, showing that CUBE correctly exploits the additional degree of parallelism inherent in the problem.</span></span>-->

			<!--<span class="justify">Abstract: <span class="black">We consider the Social Ridesharing (SR) problem, where a set of commuters, connected through a social network, arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we focus on the associated optimisation problem of forming cars to minimise the travel cost of the overall system modelling such problem as a graph constrained coalition formation (GCCF) problem, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network). Moreover, we significantly extend the state of the art algorithm for GCCF, i.e., the CFSS algorithm, to solve our GCCF model of the SR problem. Our empirical evaluation uses a real dataset for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), to validate the applicability of our approach in a realistic application scenario. Empirical results show that our approach computes optimal solutions for systems of medium scale (up to 100 agents) providing significant cost reductions (up to -36.22%). Moreover, we can provide approximate solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) and good quality guarantees (i.e., with an approximation ratio of 1.41 in the worst case) within minutes (i.e., 100 seconds).</span></span>-->

			<!--<span class="justify">Abstract: <span class="black">We consider the coalition structure generation (CSG) problem on synergy graphs, which arises in many practical applications where communication constraints, social or trust relationships must be taken into account when forming coalitions. We propose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge contraction, and an innovative branch and bound approach (CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of characteristic functions. This new model provides a non-redundant partition of the search space, hence allowing an effective parallelisation. We evaluate CFSS on two benchmark functions, the edge sum with coordination cost and the collective energy purchasing functions, comparing its performance with the best algorithm for CSG on synergy graphs: DyCE. The latter approach is centralised and cannot be efficiently parallelised due to the exponential memory requirements in the number of agents, which limits its scalability (while CFSS memory requirements are only polynomial). Our results show that, when the graphs are very sparse, CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than DyCE. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime approximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems (i.e., with more than 2700 agents).</span></span>-->

			<!--<span class="justify">Abstract: <span class="black">Matching demand and supply is recognized as a crucial issue for smart grids, and ICT-based solutions are essential to deliver the infrastructure, algorithms and mechanisms for demand-supply balancing. To date, most work in this area focus on providing users with real time feedback on energy prices and consumption, or on load scheduling of home appliances for individual user consumption. In this paper, we take a complementary approach by exploiting social relationships among consumers to organise them into coalitions of Virtual Electricity Consumers (VECs) that buy electricity as a single customer in order to get a discount on electricity through collective buying. Specifically, we model our problem as a coalitional game and provide an algorithm, based on linear programming, to form VECs. The VECs formed by our algorithm are both efficient (i.e., minimizing the sum of users’ payments) and stable (i.e., no user has any incentive to break away). We empirically analyse our approach using real consumption data for a set of households located in UK. Our analysis provides interesting insights into the relationship between structure and stability of VEC’s and prices within the electricity market.</span></span>-->
